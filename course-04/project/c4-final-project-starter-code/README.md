# Serverless TODO
Hello reviewer
This is my capstone project, I reuse project 4 (serverless TODOs application) 


# New feature : Pagination
Apply knowledge from lesson 2, I implement pagination to this app. It requires to enhance FE and BE and also configuration without breaking the app

I  also intent to implement the sorting feature but it should be done later


## Backend : 
Modify getTodo API to consume number of item per page and return the encrypted NextKey along with todo list

## FrontEnd : 
Modify getTodo request, pass the page size (input from UI) and index of first element to BE (which is get from previous request) 
Store this index to a list to use when click on next / previous button


# Screenshots

I also push screenshots to repository, please help to check. They are :
